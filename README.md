# Othello

I know that I do not own any of the images, and the use I made of it could very well be copyright infringement, so be more carefull with it than I was.

To run it install the tkinter library or just run it as script usuing Pyzo.
then run the "mainGUI.py fileand all shoud go nicely, except that it will behave very weirdly if your screen resolution is not 1366x768.
